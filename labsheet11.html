Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is an engineer, business magnate, investor, and philanthropist.[2][3][4] He is a citizen of South Africa, Canada, and the United States (where he has lived most of his life and currently resides), and is the founder, CEO and chief engineer/designer of SpaceX;[5] co-founder, CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc.;[6][7] founder of The Boring Company;[8] co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI.[9] He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[10][11] In December 2016, he was ranked 21st on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People,[12] and was ranked joint first on the Forbes list of the Most Innovative Leaders of 2019.[13] He has a net worth of $38.2 billion and is listed by Forbes as the 23rd-richest person in the world.[1] He is the longest tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[14]

Born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a Bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. He began a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University in 1995 but dropped out after two days to pursue a business career. He subsequently co-founded Zip2 with his brother Kimbal, a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002.[6][15][16][17]

In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He joined Tesla, Inc., an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded,[6] and became its CEO and product architect. In 2006, he inspired the creation of SolarCity, a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces. In December 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel-construction company focused on tunnels specialized for electric vehicles.

Apart from Tesla, Musk is not an investor in the stock market.[18] In addition to his primary business pursuits, Musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop, and has proposed a vertical take-off and landing supersonic jet electric aircraft with electric fan propulsion, known as the Musk electric jet.[19] Musk has said the goals of SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity revolve around his vision to change the world and humanity.[20] His goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and reducing the risk of human extinction by establishing a human colony on Mars.[21][22]

Early life

Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,[23] the son of Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada,[24] and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor. He has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[28] His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian.[29][30] His paternal grandmother was British, and he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[31][32] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria,[31] a choice made by Musk two years after his parents separated but which he subsequently regretted.[33] Musk is estranged from his father whom he has referred to as "a terrible human being".[33] He has a half-sister[34] and a half-brother.[35]

During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader.[36] At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.[37] He taught himself computer programming and, by the age of 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[38][39] A web version of the game is available online.[38][40] His childhood reading included Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, from which he drew the lesson that "you should try to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one".[33]

Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then smashed his head into the pavement until he lost consciousness.[33] The damage to his nose required corrective surgery.[36][41]

Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School[41] before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School. Although Musk's father insisted that Elon go to college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to move to the United States, saying "I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great things are possible, more than any other country in the world."[42] Knowing it would be easy to get to the United States from Canada, he moved to Canada against his father's wishes in June 1989, just before his 18th birthday,[43] after obtaining a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.[44][45]
Education
I do think there’s a good framework for thinking. It is physics. ... What I mean by that is: boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy.

Elon Musk, [46]

While awaiting Canadian documentation, Musk attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[47] Once in Canada, Musk entered Queen's University in 1989, avoiding mandatory service in the South African military. He left in 1992 to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania; he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.[48][49]

In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at an energy storage start-up called Pinnacle Research Institute which researched electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage; and at the Palo Alto-based start-up Rocket Science Games.[50] His work at Rocket Science Games involved assembly programming of device drivers. Bruce Leak, the former lead engineer behind Apple’s QuickTime who had hired Musk noted: “He had boundless energy. Kids these days have no idea about hardware or how stuff works, but he had a PC hacker background and was not afraid to just go figure things out.”[51]

In 1995, Musk commenced a PhD in energy physics/materials science at Stanford University in California. Eager to pursue opportunities in the Internet boom, he dropped out after just two days to launch his first company, Zip2 Corporation.[52]
Career
Zip2
Main article: Zip2

In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web software company, with money raised from a small group of angel investors.[33] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions and yellow pages.[53][54] The vector graphics mapping and direction code was implemented by Musk in Java.[55] Musk obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune[56] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[57] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.[36] Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307 million in cash[36]:109 and US$34 million in stock options[citation needed] in February 1999.[58] Musk received US$22 million for his 7 percent share from the sale.[56][36]:109
X.com and PayPal
Main articles: PayPal and X.com

In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2.[43][53][57] One year later, the company merged with Confinity,[56][59] which had a money-transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001. PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service.[60] Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire to move PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows.[61] In October 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk received US$165 million.[62] Before its sale, Musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of PayPal's shares.[63]

In July 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it has sentimental value to him.[64]

In 2001, Musk conceived Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars, containing food crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to reawaken public interest in space exploration.[65][66] In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the Russian chief designers.[67] The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for US$8 million. Musk considered the price too high, and stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed.[67] According to early Tesla and SpaceX investor Steve Jurvetson,[68] Musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. It was concluded that, in theory, by applying vertical integration and the modular approach employed in software engineering, SpaceX could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin.[69] Ultimately, Musk ended up founding SpaceX with the long-term goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization.[70]
